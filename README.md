# StockForecaster

Simple RNN model to predict stock prices. For demo puposes the training and benchmarking is done with the prices of the SP500.

To get started a folder 'assets' should be created at the same level as 'src', and within in it another folder named 'models'. Here the trained model will be stored, after running the 'train_model.py' script. And can be used later in the 'test_model.py' script.
